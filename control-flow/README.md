## 🧠 Objective

Demonstrate the use of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to guide program execution in Python based on user input.

## 🚀 How It Works

The script prompts the user to input the weather condition from a predefined list and then gives suitable clothing advice.

### Supported Weather Conditions:
- `sunny` → Wear a t-shirt and sunglasses.
- `rainy` → Don't forget your umbrella and a raincoat.
- `cold` → Make sure to wear a warm coat and a scarf.
- Other inputs → Sorry, I don't have recommendations for this weather.

## 💻 Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python weather_advice.py
   ```

2. Enter the current weather when prompted:

   ```
   What's the weather like today? (sunny/rainy/cold):
   ```

3. Receive a clothing recommendation based on your input.

## 📄 Example
